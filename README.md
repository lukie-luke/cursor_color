# Overview
A simple batch file to change the cursor color in Windows 10.

## Explaination

For some reason, Windows 10 tends to revert the cursor color to the default upon sleep, startup, program installs, etc. I use this batch file to locate a preset cursor that I have saved and apply it.

## Process

### 0.1

My first attempt was to have the batch file input the key commands that I have used to accomplish this cursor change and close the control pannel:

WINDOWS KEY -> "Control Pannel" -> ENTER -> "Mouse" -> CTRL+TAB - > ENTER -> ALT+F4

### 0.2

I discovered that there is an easier way to acces the control pannel with "start control" in the batch file. I have also had issues with the key inputs in selecting the mouse settings after opening the control pannel. I am currently looking for another route that does not go through the control pannel.
